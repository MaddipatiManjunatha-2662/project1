<p>12 Best Things to Do in Istanbul</p>
<p>Istanbul has a timeless charm that owes much to its rich history. The
city was historically referred to as Byzantium and Constantinople. It served
as a focal point of several ancient empires. Numerous architectural wonders,
remnants of these empires, still stand tall in the heart of the city. These
include the Hagia Sophia, which stood the tests of time and continues to
invite awe with its display of dazzling mosaics.</p>
<p>Besides Istanbul’s historical sites, you can find modern skyscrapers
and malls. There are cool spots in and around the city to escape to, some of
which offer breathtaking views over the city and the Bosporus Strait. Read on
for more ideas on things to do in Istanbul, to help you discover the best of
this alluring Turkish city and cultural melting pot. </p>

<p>There’s no mistaking it: the Eiffel Tower rips through the air like a
giant. This impressive symbol of France can be seen from almost anywhere in
the city. Reigning 324 meters high, the iron tower has dominated the Parisian
horizon ever since the 1889 Universal Exhibition.
Its construction -- completed in just 2 years, 2 months and 5 days --
was an incredibly technical and architectural feat. Meant to stay standing for
only 20 years, the Eiffel Tower was saved by its immense popularity and by
Gustave Eiffel’s scientific experiments. In fact, its creator suggested a more
functional purpose to the tower: use it as an antenna for the first
radiophonic transmissions. Although its existence was controversial from the
beginning, the Eiffel Tower ended up conquering the hearts and minds of its
most ardent critics. Today, the Eiffel Tower is home to numerous events that
attract people from all around the world.</p>

<p>Bali's beauty goes way deeper than its beautiful appearances. Matching
Bali's natural wonders are its ever-growing choice of awesome accommodations.
From lavish resorts to affordable hostels, developers go all-out to create
outstanding, well-equipped and enjoyable places to stay. Private villas can
even be rented at unbelievably affordable prices. Many resorts and hotels have
splendid swimming and infinity pools, most of which are attractions in
themselves.</p>

<p>Dubai is an ideal holiday destination for families, with theme parks,
beaches, Friday brunches and more to keep everyone happy. The famous Burj
Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, is well worth the entrance fee.
Burj Al-Arab, often touted as the world's only 7-star hotel, remains
underwhelming. Similarly, the Aquaventure Water Park at the Palms Atlantis
Hotel is not to be missed. Jumeriah Beach Residence is well established as
Dubai's most popular beachfront, and its close proximity to a whole host of
restaurants, cafes and shops make it more than worthy of its status.</p>

<p>When you are into a goodnight’s sleep, you go to bed and when you are
into all-nighters, you go to Bangkok. Well, nothing brings forth the surreal
charm of this world quite like nights and no place else complements it like
Bangkok and Bangkok’s nightlife. Ah, the bling on the streets, neon light
washed avenues, and the exhilarating energy, Bangkok is probably the only
place in the world where the nights resonate with kaleidoscopic life.
Some say that travelling and exploring places are activities to pursue
in the daylight, for the view is clearer and better. They probably haven’t
been to Bangkok, one of the very few places in the entire world, famous for
its nightlife. Bangkok is the capital and most populous city of Thailand.
Bangkok is famous amongst travellers and tourists alike as it is home to some
of the most important historical and cultural structures. However, the
majority of the crowd visiting Bangkok is after the fun Bangkok nightlife has
on offer. From Bangkok’s best bars and clubs to Bangkok’s finest street food,
the nightlife in Bangkok promises to offer the best of The Big Mango alias
Bangkok.</p>

<p>The city of Geneva (ville de Genève) had a population of 203,951 in
January 2020[7] within its municipal territory of 16 km2 (6 sq mi),[8] but the
larger Canton of Geneva had a population of 504,128[7] over 246 km2 (95 sq
mi).[8] The Geneva metropolitan area as officially defined by Eurostat,[9]
including suburbs and exurbs in Vaud and the French departments of Ain and
Haute-Savoie, extends over 2,292 km2 (885 sq mi)[10] and had a population of
1,044,766 at the time.[11]
Since 2013, the Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District (in the canton of
Vaud), and the Pôle métropolitain du Genevois français (lit. 'Metropolitan hub
of the French Genevan territory', a federation of eight French intercommunal
councils), have formed Grand Genève ("Greater Geneva"), a Local Grouping of
Transnational Cooperation (GLCT in French, a public entity under Swiss law) in
charge of organizing cooperation within the cross-border metropolitan area of
Geneva (in particular metropolitan transports).[12] The Grand Genève GLCT
extends over 1,996 km2 (771 sq mi)[13] and had a population of 1,037,407 in
Jan. 2020 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.4% of them living on Swiss

<p>Port Blair is an alluring destination for tourists as it includes a
host of attractive locales. There are shimmering but clean beaches, beaches
that defy the ferocity of sea and let tourists swim leisurely, relics of
colonial power and oppression, many must-go museums, libraries, coral reefs,
and more.</p>

<p>The capital of one of the most powerful ancient empires in the world,
Rome is a fascinating place that has inspired people to visit for millennia.
With incredible works of art, a leisurely pace of life and world-renowned
cuisine, the Eternal City is worth a visit at least once, though it would take
a lifetime to see all it has to offer.</p>
